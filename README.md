This project takes the CSV file of the ACNC registered charities and converts it into a MYSQL database table.
The CSV in the project root is up-to-date as of 11/02/2023 however you can get the most up to date 
CSV file from: https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-b050b242-4487-4306-abf5-07ca073e5594/details?q=acnc

The ACNC registered charities list is useful in the database form as you could use the database alongside an API to 
create applications that fetch unique information about Australian charities.
